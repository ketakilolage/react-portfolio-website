# Personal Portfolio Website Template

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).\
This is a sample one-page portfolio website for developers to showcase their skills and experiences.\
Feel free to fork the repo and customize for yourself. You do not need to credit me but it's always nice to be appreciated!

### Instructions

To deploy the app to GitHub pages as a Project Site:
1. Clone the repo into a local directory.
2. Run `npm install` to install all the required dependencies.
3. Change the `homepage` property in package.json to the GitHub pages URL where you want the website to be available.
4. Run `git remote remove origin` and `git remote add origin <your-github-repo-url>` to configure the GitHub setup.
5. Run `npm start` to run the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.\
Any changes you make will be reflected through hot reload.
6. Once ready to deploy, run `npm run build` to build the app for production. This creates a `build` folder.
7. Run `npm run deploy`. This creates a branch called `gh-pages` in your GitHub repo and uploads the build folder to it.\
Your website is now live!

### Improvements
Assets (images, CV) and content (project descriptions, skills) could be stored in a remote cloud solution such as Firebase and fetched upon request.
